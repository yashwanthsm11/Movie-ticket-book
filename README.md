Installation Instructions
To run this project locally, you need to install the required dependencies. This project has two main directories: the root project folder and the client folder. Each of these directories contains its own set of dependencies. Follow the steps below to ensure everything is set up correctly:

Install Dependencies in the Root Project Folder:
Navigate to the root directory of the project (where the package.json file is located) and run the following command:
npm install
This command will install all the required packages for the backend and any shared utilities.

Install Dependencies in the Client Folder:
Next, navigate to the client folder (which contains the frontend code) and run the same command:
cd client
npm install

This step ensures that all the frontend dependencies are installed correctly.

Once the dependencies are installed in both locations, you can proceed to start the development servers or build the application as needed. Refer to the subsequent sections for instructions on running the application.

command to run backend
In root folder : nodemon server/server.js

command to run frontend
In client folder: npm start
